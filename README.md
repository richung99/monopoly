# Monopoly Heatmap Generator

Generates heatmaps of the Monopoly game board based using Java simulations and MATLAB.

## Running the Code

After downloading from GitHub, start by running MonopolyDriver.java, which will generate all the necessary CSV files for MATLAB to process and plot. The number of players, turns, and games can be edited directly in lines 10â€“12 of this script. After the relevant CSV files are generated, the MATLAB script will generate and save figures as PNG files in the directory.

## Example Heatmaps and Plots
